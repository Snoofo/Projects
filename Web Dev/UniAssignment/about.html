					Currently a student at Macquarie University studying a Bachelor of IT majoring in Games Design and Development, I am a technology enthusiast who loves playing with programming languages. I call this playing because a lot of the fun comes from trial and error, seeing how things change as you update your code. There is a lot of satisfaction in 'building' something to show for your work.<br>
					This site was developed for a unit in my degree, MAS240, and has been an awesome motivator to learn a lot more about website design. HTML and CSS can be some of the most visually creative languages out there, so if you enjoy design and have a creative spark I highly encourage you to try it out!<br>
					I am currently trying to gain as much knowledge in software development in multiple languages to one day become a proffesional developer and create my own applications, or even better, become a part of a team of fellow minded enthusiasts!<br>
					I plan to implement a posting system of some form, perhaps a forum style page to allow sharing of information and news so hopefully I can hear about your thoughts from then!
